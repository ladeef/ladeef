<b>Service Description: </b> The Livable Centers Initiative (LCI) is a program that awards planning grants on a competitive basis to local governments and nonprofit organizations to prepare and implement plans for the enhancement of existing centers and corridors consistent with regional development policies, and also provides transportation infrastructure funding for projects identified in the LCI plans.​​​

Invest Atlanta serves as a redevelopment agent for all tax allocation districts (TADs) formed within the City of Atlanta. TADs, also known as tax increment financing (TIF), are one of the City of Atlanta’s key economic development tools used to incentivize a variety of developments, such as housing, community centers, commercial space and other essential elements key to vibrant, prosperous communities. These incentivizes are intended to promote development in areas of the city that are targeted for increased investment.

Certain areas within the City of Atlanta meet the State of Georgia criteria for targeted urban redevelopment, as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Law (O.C.G.A. 36-61). These areas present conditions such as deteriorating or inadequate infrastructure; a predominance of dilapidated or vacant buildings, higher levels of poverty and unemployment and other signs of blight and distress. The persistence of these conditions substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of the City and constitutes an economic and social liability that is a menace to the public health, safety, and welfare.

The Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-554) authorized the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to designate “Renewal Communities.

The Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community and Renewal Community
program (hereafter, EZ) is a federally sponsored effort to revitalize economically
distressed and impoverished areas across the U.S. When it was first developed in
1993, the program consisted of a series of grant funds and tax incentives that were to
be used by awarded communities for projects and activities that would increase
employment, reduce poverty, and improve overall quality of life.

Opportunity Zones are Georgia’s best tax credit for job creation. Businesses creating two or more net jobs in a tax year may be eligible to receive a State tax credit of $3,500 per employee if their businesses are located in eligible zones.

The New Markets Tax Credits (NMTC) program was created by the U.S Congress in 2000 to attract private investment to revitalize neighborhoods with high rates of poverty and unemployment. To date, over $50 billion has been invested nationwide through the NMTC program to finance commercial, industrial, community facility, and mixed-use real estate projects in qualifying Census tracts.

The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) will provide emergency assistance to state and local governments to acquire and redevelop abandoned or foreclosed properties that might otherwise become sources of abandonment and blight within their communities. NSP funds can not be used to acquire homes from current owners.
